# Egg Language Parser Notes

Working through Chapter 11 of Eloquent JavaScript.
Code reference: ch11.parse.and.eval.js

## 1st Iteration

run() first call: (line 150)
	
run() function first defines environemnt variable by creating an instance of topEnv (line 144). Next run creates array of all arguments passed to it and then joins that array together into a long string using newline characters (line 145).

`var program = Array.prototype....`
returns:

	"do(define(total, 0),
		define(count, 1),
		while(<(count, 11),
			do(define(total, +(total, count)),
				define(count, +(count, 1)))),
		print(total))"

	So program is above string.

run() then returns call to evaluate, where parse(program) is passed as an argument along with env variable. (line 147)

parse(program) defines result variable as return value on call to to parseExpression(program) (line 44)

parseExpression(program) passes program variable to skipSpace() (line 2). skipSpace() makes no changes to string because first character is "d" (line 22).

first characters in string: "do " match third regex: `/^[^\s(),"]+/` and so 

	expr = {type: "word", name: "do" };

parseExpression then returns parseApply(expr, program) where program becomes:

	"(define(total, 0),
		define(count, 1),
		while(<(count, 11),
			do(define(total, +(total, count)),
				define(count, +(count, 1)))),
		print(total))"

parseApply attempts to remove spaces from beginning of program string (line 26) and makes no changes becasue first character is '('. if first character in program is not '('' parseApply() would return an object. However, since it is a '(' character parseApply function slices the first character from the program string (line 31). expr object is defined containing type "apply", operator expr object which was passed as argument and args an empty array (line 32). Thus expr object is:

	expr = {type: "apply", operator: {type: "word", name: "do"}, args: []}

parseApply() then enters while loop which will break upon encountering close parenthesis ')'. Defines arg variable as parseExpression return of program in current state (line 34).

## 2nd Iteration

parseExpression() function is passed the following string: 

	"define(total, 0),
		define(count, 1),
		while(<(count, 11),
			do(define(total, +(total, count)),
				define(count, +(count, 1)))),
		print(total))"

Beginning of string, 'define', matches third regular expression `/^[^\s(),"]` (Line 8). 

	expr = {type: "word", name: "define"}

parseExpression() function returns call to parseApply with expr and the following as arguments:

	"(total, 0),
		define(count, 1),
		while(<(count, 11),
			do(define(total, +(total, count)),
				define(count, +(count, 1)))),
		print(total))"

parseApply first checks for spaces at beginning of program string (line 26), then checks to make sure first character is '(' (line 27). parseApply() then slices first character from beginning of program string (line 31) and defines expr object (line 32) which contains the expr object that was passed as an argument. parseApply thus has an expr object as follows:

	expr = {type: "apply", operator: {type: "word", name: "define"}, args: []}

parseApply() then enters while loop and defines arg variable as return from parseExpression() function.

## 3rd Iteration

parseExpression(program) where program is:

	total, 0),
		define(count, 1),
		while(<(count, 11),
			do(define(total, +(total, count)),
				define(count, +(count, 1)))),
		print(total))

Matches third regular expression: `^[^\s(),"]+` so expr becomes

	expr = {type "word", name: "total"}

function returns call to parseApply with arguments expr, above, and program text with the first 5 characters trimmed off (program.slice(match[0].length)).

parseApply(expr, program) first checks for spaces at the beginning of program string. Since first character is ',' no changes are made. parseApply() function then checks to see if first character is '(', since it is not, returns object containing expr & program variables.

	{expr: {type: "word", name: "total"}, rest: program}

where program is

	, 0),
		define(count, 1),
		while(<(count, 11),
			do(define(total, +(total, count)),
				define(count, +(count, 1)))),
		print(total))	

Above object is returned from parseApply() to parseExpression() which returns it to previous recursion (#2) of parseApply which is still inside while loop. so var arg in 2nd iteration while loop becomes:

	var arg = {expr: {type: "word", name: "total"}, rest: program}

where program is same as above. var arg is added to args array in parseApply()'s expr object so that expr object becomes:

	{type: "apply", operator: {type: "word", name: "define"}, args: [{type: "word", name: "total"}]}

program is then passed to skipSpace(), no change, and then enters if statement which trims ',' and following space from program which becomes:

	0),
		define(count, 1),
		while(<(count, 11),
			do(define(total, +(total, count)),
				define(count, +(count, 1)))),
		print(total))	

Loop starts again. var arg = parseExpression(program) with program above. parseExpression matches 0 to value using 2nd regular expression `/^\d+\b/`. returns call to parseApply which returns {expr: {type: "value", value: 0}, rest: program} where program is above except with first character, "0", chopped off. Thus back in 2nd iteration while loop (2nd time through loop) `var arg = {expr: {type: "value", value: 0}`. arg.expr is then pushed to args array within parseApply() function's expr object which thus becomes:

	expr = {type: "apply", operator: {type: "word", name: "define"}, args: [{type: "word", name: "total"}, {type: "value", value: 0}]}	

While loop exits because program[0] = ")". parseApply returns call to itself passing above expr and program:

	,
		define(count, 1),
		while(<(count, 11),
			do(define(total, +(total, count)),
				define(count, +(count, 1)))),
		print(total))	

Call stack is briefly 3 layers deep in recursion, however call to parseApply immediately returns object containing above expr & project because program[0] != "(". Thus call stack should be able to return to while loop within first iteration of parseApply(). 

## 1st Iteration	

The above returns to first call of parseApply, which was called as a return from parseExpression() within while loop defining var arg (line 34). This would push the above expr object into the local expr args array and set the program variable to be equal to what was returned from the previous parseExpression call which is also the most recent program text above. The loop would then continue to prune the comma (",") and spaces from the program text (line 38 within if). The loop then restarts, var arg = parseExpression(program) where the program argument passed is:

	define(count, 1),
	while(<(count, 11),
		do(define(total, +(total, count)),
			define(count, +(count, 1)))),
	print(total))

For reference this level of parseApply current has a expr object containing the following data:

	expr = {type: "apply", 
			operator: {type: "word", 
						name: "do"}, 
			args: [{type: "apply", 
					operator: {type: "word", 
								name: "define"}, 
					args: [{type: "word", name: "total"}, 
							{type: "value", value: 0}
							]
					}]
			}
