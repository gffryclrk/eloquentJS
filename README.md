## Eloquent JS Solutions

As I work through Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke (2nd Ed.) I'm publishing my exercise solutions up here for the world to see; warts and all. 

## FILES

My file-naming convention is pretty obvious: chx.0y.z.js where x is the chapter and y is the sequential exercise for said chapter. When there's a z present it represents additional attempts either at a later date or after I have read the hints or solutions and decided I needed to improve upon my original solution. I've kept the original solutions for comparison purposes.

## GOALS

The goal of this exercise is quite simply to improve my knowledge and competency with JavaScript. 

## CHAPTER 6: Secret Life of Objects

I was having a bit of a hard time with the meat of this chapter: the table drawing program. I after struggling I ended up going back to the start of the chapter and re-reading everything multiple times while typing out all the code. This was a good exercise. While doing so I worked on some snippets for my text editor (currently Sublime Text 3) and got a better feel of what I was trying to accomplish. I've also included comments and examples. I watched some screencasts to help with this and also read some 3rd party posts about this chapter specifically including http://tomi.io/eloquent-javascript-laying-out-a-table/ which I found to be very helpful.
