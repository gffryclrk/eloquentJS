## Eloquent JS Solutions

As I work through Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke (2nd Ed.) I'm publishing my exercise solutions up here for the world to see; warts and all. 

## Files

My file-naming convention is pretty obvious: chx.0y.z.js where x is the chapter, y is the sequential exercise for said chapter. When there's a z present it represents additional attempts either at a later date or after I have read the hints or solutions and decided I needed to improve upon my original solution. I've kept the original solutions for comparison purposes.

## Goals

The goal of this exercise is quite simply to improve my knowledge and competency with JavaScript.
